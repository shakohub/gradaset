    "<b>What is Machine Learning?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the field of study that focuses on giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Supervised Machine Learning (SML), data models - also known as algorithms - learn from labeled data. Learning the data includes understanding the patterns and relationships that exist within your dataset and between variables. Once the model understands the data - it is able to associate the patterns that were discovered to unlabeled data. In other words, the model takes information that it's learned and applies it to an environment where it isn't being directly told what to do - similar to a student who learns through lessons (examples and exercises where the correct answer is provided) and then is expected to apply what they've learned on a test (answers are not provided). Once your model has \"taken the test\", it is then up to you to grade it to determine how well your model performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of SML algorithms: regression and classification. \n",
    "* <b>Regression</b> predicts continuous values (i.e. sales).\n",
    "* <b>Classification</b> predicts discrete outcomes (i.e. survived/died).\n",
    "\n",

    "Today's lesson will focus on Linear Regression. Not unlike Linear Regression with Statsmodels (Module 6), we are interested in creating a linear regression models that fits our data well. However, unlike Statsmodels, we aren't only interested in learning about the relationships within the dataset we have in front of us -- we are also interested in creating a linear regression model that can help us make predictions with data we don't yet have, or data we can anticipate getting in the future. To do this, there are several new steps that we will have to complete, including:\n",
    "* Cleaning up our data\n",
    "* Handling categorical variables\n",
    "* Dividing our data into two sets of data based on the dependent and independent variables\n",
    "* Determining the characteristics of our linear regression model\n",
    "* Splitting our data into subsets\n",
    "* Training our model\n",
    "* Testing our model\n",
    "* And finally, evaluating how well our model did at predicting outcomes\n",
    "***************************************\n",
    "Creating a linear regression model is typically done with the goal of making <b>acurate</b> predictions about your dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data regarding student grades, we are hoping to predict the final grade of a student given various characteristics. Our goal is to not only better understand the relationship between student characteristics and their final grade, but to create a model that can accurately predict the grade a student will receive given several other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a teacher created a model, based on historic data, that could accurately predict final grade - they could input student information into the model during the middle of the term to predict how well a student is expected to perform. With this information, they can intervene early if a student is on the path to performing poorly in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is only one example, but forcasting future trends/predicting specific outcomes is the main objective with linear regression. However, the full utility of your model will not be made evident immediately - instead of working through all of the uses of your model, this lesson is going to cover how to create an accuarate linear regression model that fits with your data.\n",

    "* <b>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</b>: this is a measure of how closely the fitted regression line is to the actual data points. The smaller the MSE, the closer the fit is to the data. There is no golden standard for an acceptable MSE value -- typically, this value is used to compare different iterations of models (similar to using the adj R^2 to determine which models fit the data the best). You can use this value to determine which model is a better fit for your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</b>: this is the square-root of the MSE, and is much easier to directly interpret. A well-fitting regression model results in predicted values that are close to the observed data values. The RMSE indicates how the model fits to the data -- in other words, how close the observed data points are to the model's predicted values. RSME is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the outcome. The RMSE can be interpreted as the average difference in the observed values and the predicted values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you calculate these values, you can determine if you are happy with the results. If not, you should tweak your initial model, run through the training/testing process again, and determine if another model is a better fit. In some instances, the accuracy of the model is important but it isn't vital to the work you want to do with the model -- for example, a model that is designed to predict how much money a customer plans to spend in your store will still be functional if the predictions are off by $10. However, a model that predicts the rate of growth of a brain tumor -- accuracy of the predictions are going to be a lot more important.  \n",

    "<b>Need more data:</b> We need to have a huge amount of data to get the best possible prediction. \n",
